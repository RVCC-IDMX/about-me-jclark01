        <p>Hello, I’m James. I have been a student at Raritan Valley Community College since 2019. Previously, 
            I took a computer literacy class where I learned the basics of computer hardware and software 
            (specifically Microsoft PowerPoint, Word, Excel). As of writing, I’m currently unsure if a want to obtain 
            an IT certificate or pursue a certificate outside of the IT department. In the summer, I like to attend 
            car shows and enjoy the outdoors.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

        <p>My main hobbies include collecting old computers and video games and home improvement. 
            Some unique Apple computers I have include an Apple IIc, Macintosh SE, iMac G3, iMac G5, and an eMac. 
            I also have an old Compaq laptop running Windows 98, a Dell laptop with Windows XP, and even an old 
            ThinkPad with a Chinese keyboard layout. In my spare time, I especially like to mess around with old 
            computer software and settings. Primarily intended for old versions of Windows. For video game consoles 
            I have an Atari 2600, Gameboy, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Dreamcast, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and 
            an original Xbox. As far as home improvement goes, I renovated two bathrooms, revamped my laundry room, 
            had a gas line connected to the house, and added lights in the downstairs family room. All of that was 
            done around my house throughout the past six years.</p>

    <h2>Blog: Image Hover Effects</h2>

<div>
    
<p>
    Image hover effects are transitions that can be added to an image which a user can interact with when hovered 
    over. This works by adding ‘:hover’ to the selector you want to apply the effect to. For example, I applied the 
    property ‘transform: scale’ to the pictures in the Photo Gallery section on this web page which makes the pictures 
    larger once hovered over. I set the scale ‘(1.10)’ which tells how big the image is supposed to enlarge. 
    Adding this property alone does not make the image smoothly transition which is where ‘transition-duration’ 
    comes in. Adding the ‘transition-duration’ property not only will make image transition smoothly but also lets 
    you set how long it will take for it to complete. I set the property to ‘.8s’ for the three pictures.
</p>

<p>
    Initially, I had some problems adding the hover transition effect to the pictures. First, I added the selector 
    ‘#gallery :hover’ into my CSS. Then, I added ‘transform: scale’ and ‘transition-duration’ properties under 
    ‘#gallery :hover’. The effect was applied to both the pictures and fig captions, but the fig captions would not 
    scale with picture that the cursor was hovering over. Also, the pictures would become too big once hovered over 
    which would be distracting to visitors. Not to mention, the ‘transition-duration’ effect worked when hovering 
    over, but snaped back into place when hovering off the picture.
</p>

<p>
    To resolve the issues, I changed the selector to ‘gallery figure:hover’, which fixed the issue with fig captions 
    not scaling with the pictures. I then changed the ‘transformation: scale’ setting from ‘(2)’ to ‘(1.10)’ which 
    makes the pictures not scale too big. Lastly, I added ‘transition-duration’ to ‘#gallery figure’ so that the 
    pictures scale back into place when hovered off.
</p>
    
<p>
    In the demo below, I applied the properties ‘transform: rotate’, ‘filter: grayscale’, and ‘opacity’ to the 
    picture when it’s not hovered over. To make the picture upside down, I set ‘transform: rotate’ to ‘(180deg)’ 
    which tells what angle it needs to be positioned at. To make the picture somewhat black and white, I set 
    ‘filter: grayscale’ to ‘(80%)’. And finally, I set ‘opacity’ to ‘44%’ which tell the picture how transparent 
    it’s supposed to appear. I also added ease-in-out to ‘transition-duration: .8s’ which makes it start and end a 
    little slower (it may be hard to notice). These properties are under the ‘#demo img’ as suppose to the 
    ‘#demo img:hover’ selector. Otherwise, the picture would appear in its normal state when not hovered over.
</p>

<p>
    For the picture to transition to its normal state when hovered over, I applied the reverse settings in 
    ‘#demo img:hover’. I set both the ‘transform: rotate’ and ‘filter: grayscale’ both to 0, and the ‘opacity’ to 
    100. The ‘transition-duration’ property uses in the same settings as used in ‘#demo img’. If you were to not 
    include the reverse properties, hovering over the picture would not affect it at all.
</p>

<p>
    Much like how I had problems getting the photo gallery to work properly, I also had some problem with the demo. 
    For example, my picture would transition when hovering close to the image instead of only transitioning on it. 
    Overall, CSS can be very finicky. But when it works, its guaranteed to satisfy you as a coder.
