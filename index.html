        <p>Hello, I’m James. I have been a student at Raritan Valley Community College since 2019. Previously, 
            I took a computer literacy class where I learned the basics of computer hardware and software 
            (specifically Microsoft PowerPoint, Word, Excel). As of writing, I’m currently unsure if a want to obtain 
            an IT certificate or pursue a certificate outside of the IT department. In the summer, I like to attend 
            car shows and enjoy the outdoors.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

        <p>My main hobbies include collecting old computers and video games and home improvement. 
            Some unique Apple computers I have include an Apple IIc, Macintosh SE, iMac G3, iMac G5, and an eMac. 
            I also have an old Compaq laptop running Windows 98, a Dell laptop with Windows XP, and even an old ThinkPad 
            with a Chinese keyboard layout. For video game consoles I have an Atari 2600, Gameboy, Super Nintendo, 
            Sega Genesis, Dreamcast, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and an original Xbox. As far as home improvement goes, 
            I renovated two bathrooms, revamped my laundry room, had a gas line connected to the house, and added lights 
            in the downstairs family room. All of that was done around my house throughout the past six years.</p>

    <h2>Dracula (To be Blog Article)</h2>

    <p>We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself 
        fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said to her were:--</p>

    <p>"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door."</p>

    <p>"I promise," said Lucy, "and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! 
    Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?"</p>

    <p>As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--</p>

    <p>"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel, 
    much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, 
    and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, 
    and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"</p>

    <p>He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, 
    felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, 
    but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears. 12 September.
    --How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing. 
    I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. 
    And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, 
    and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window. 
    Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, 
    or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, 
    whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, 
    and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, 
    with "virgin crants and maiden strewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! 
    There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody. 13 September.
    --Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.</p>

    <p>Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o'clock. 
    It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion 
    of nature's annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, 
    but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. 
    She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--</p>

    <p>"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, 
    but did not go in, lest I should disturb her." The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. 
    He rubbed his hands together, and said:--</p>

    <p>"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working," to which she answered:--</p>
