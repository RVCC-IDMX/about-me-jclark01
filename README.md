When picking the color scheme for the site, I kept in mind that some people may not be able to make out the text if the background a similar color (especially for those who are color blind). Also, if I were to make the page too colorful (like if I where use light blue for the background and red or purple for the text) it would look unprofessional. Then I thought if I were to make the background light gray (#dddddd) and text blue (#3631F0) it be easy for anyone to read whether if you colorblind or not and would look more professional.
